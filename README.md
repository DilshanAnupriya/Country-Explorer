## Challenges and Solutions

*1)Challenge:* Managing large datasets returned by the API

  *Solution:* Implemented pagination and lazy loading to improve performance and reduce initial load time


*2)Challenge:* Handling inconsistent data formats across different countries

*Solution:* Created normalization functions that standardize data before displaying it to the user, ensuring a consistent user experience regardless of data variations


*3)Challenge:* Implementing efficient search across multiple attributes

*Solution:* Developed a client-side search algorithm that filters already-fetched countries when possible, falling back to API search for more comprehensive queries


*4)Challenge:* Maintaining responsive design across various screen sizes

*Solution:* Used Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes and custom media queries to ensure the application looks good on devices from mobile phones to large desktop screens


*5)Challenge:* Implementing secure user authentication

*Solution:* Created a separate authentication service with JWT tokens and secure storage, implementing proper token refresh mechanisms and session timeout handling
